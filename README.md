# music_libabry_DS
This project involves developing two programs simulating a distributed digital music library using client-server architecture over sockets. The server handles Album objects containing metadata and songs, stored in memory. Clients interact via a GUI to add, update, search, or delete albums. The server responds to client requests with success/failure updates.

# how_to_run
Open server first, and then open client to see the UI.
